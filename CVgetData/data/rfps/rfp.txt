Title: API Integration Platform Development
Client: Northbridge Logistics Sp. z o.o.
Location: Remote / Poland
Start Date: 2026-03-01
Duration: 4–6 months
Budget: 280,000–420,000 PLN (fixed price preferred)

Overview:
Northbridge Logistics is looking for a team to build an API Integration Platform that connects
internal systems (ERP, WMS, billing) with external partners (couriers, payment provider, CRM).
The platform must support multiple integration patterns, monitoring, retries, and auditing.

Scope of Work:
1) Design and implementation of an API Gateway + Integration Layer
2) Support for REST and webhooks, with optional message queue integration
3) Authentication and authorization (OAuth2/JWT)
4) Observability: centralized logging, metrics, tracing
5) Admin panel for managing integrations, partners, and API keys
6) CI/CD pipeline and containerized deployment

Technical Requirements:
- Backend: .NET 8 or Java (Spring Boot) or Python (FastAPI) – justify the choice
- Datastore: PostgreSQL preferred; optional Redis for caching
- Messaging: RabbitMQ or Kafka (nice to have)
- Containerization: Docker; Kubernetes is a plus
- API documentation: OpenAPI/Swagger
- Security: OWASP Top 10, rate limiting, audit logs

Non-Functional Requirements:
- High availability target: 99.9%
- Latency: p95 under 250ms for gateway endpoints
- Data retention: audit logs for 24 months
- GDPR compliance

Deliverables:
- Architecture document and threat model
- Source code repository + documentation
- Automated tests (unit + integration)
- Deployment scripts (Docker Compose minimum; Helm optional)
- Handover and knowledge transfer session

Evaluation Criteria:
- Relevant experience with integrations and distributed systems
- Proposed architecture and security approach
- Team composition and availability
- Total cost and timeline
- References / case studies
